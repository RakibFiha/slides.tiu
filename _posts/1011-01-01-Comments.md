### Thank you

* Graphical approaches for presentations

* Some structures

* Should emphasize on main points with very few words in one slides

* Financial system is part of IR

* This blockchain tech can contribute in advancement of financial system and whole international system

* You can develop improved financial system with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

* Monetary policies

* You can emphasize Bitcoin and other crypto as blockchain tech is more related to Bitcoin

* Case studies about particular crypto

* General perspectives of crypto

* First explain blockchain Technology

* and show that this technology can be applied in every aspect of IR

* Typical examples e.g. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies make one or 2 chapter

* 1 chapter about Bitcoin and another chapter about alt-coin

* One chapter about financial system and its improvement

* Later chapter explain about the whole international relations which is about this tech

* Conclusion: > The technology can change the whole system

* Until now, there are few examples beside bitcoin and crypto

* You can collect the data of rapid development and point out the good and bad points

* More data means better paper

* Data for quantitate Analysis

* Number of transactions > size of market > describe the history and timetable >

* Use the data between 2009 (December) - 2018 (October)

* Collection of data and writing of the paper

  * After collection of data you can decide the title

  * Then probably can use a sub-title

* Collect as many data as possible
